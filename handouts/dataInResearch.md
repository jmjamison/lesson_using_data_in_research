---

## Finding Out About Data Sources

- UCLA Library Data Archive
- Colleagues
- Public media (newspapers, news)
- Social media (twitter, etc)
- Scholarly literature
- Government reports and documents
- Archives and project websites
- Codebooks, questionnaires
- Exploration of datasets
---

## Search Strategies and Defining Your Research

- General to specific; broad to narrow
- Names of investigators; names of studies
- Studies described in literature, news and websites

## How do I know this study useful?

- Raw data are __not__ eye-readable
- To decipher data you will use __Questionnaires and Codebooks__

![illustration: codebook #1](./images/rawData.jpg "Raw Data sample")

## What is a Questionnaire?

* A __questionnaire__ is a _research instrument_ consisting of a series of _questions_ and other prompts for the purpose of gathering information from respondents.  

- Questionnaires cover separate topics such as:
	- Preferences (e.g. political party)
    - Behaviors (e.g. food consumption)
    - Facts (e.g. gender)

- Questionnaires can include indexes or scales:
	- Latent traits (e.g. personality traits)
    - Attitudes (e.g. towards immigration)
    - An index (e.g. Social Economic Status)

## Questionnaire
![illustration: Questionnaire](./images/codebook01.jpg "Questionnaire")  

---
## What is a Codebook?

- An overview of the study or dataset
- Variable names and descriptions
- Column locations (mostly this is for raw data)

### May also include:
- Test of questions if the data comes from a survey
- Example of the Questionnaire
- Detail on who responded to the survey

## What is a Data Management Plan?

A data management plan is a document that describes what you will do with your data _during_ your research and _after_ you complete your research.

## Why do you need this?

- Funding Agencies  
- Publishing 
- Sharing and Archiving Data 
- Regardless of the requirements, good data management is an essential skill for researchers. 

## Getting help

- Data Archive 
- ICPSR
