## Finding Out About Data Sources

* UCLA Library Data Archive
* Colleagues
* Public media (newspapers, news)
* Social media (twitter, etc)
* Scholarly literature
* Government reports and documents
* Archives and project websites
* Codebooks, questionnaires
* Exploration of datasets



## Search Strategies 

* General to specific; broad to narrow
* Names of investigators; names of studies
* Studies described in literature, news and websites  
![illustration: Defining Your Search](./images/DefineResearch.jpg "Defining Your Search")


## How do I know this study useful?

* Raw data are __not__ eye-readable
* To decipher data you will use __Questionnaires and Codebooks__

![illustration: Raw Data](./images/rawData.jpg "Raw Data sample")  


## What is a Questionnaire?  

* A __questionnaire__ is a _research instrument_ consisting of a series of _questions_ and other prompts for the purpose of gathering information from respondents.  

* Questionnaires cover separate topics such as:
	* Preferences (e.g. political party)
    * Behaviors (e.g. food consumption)
    * Facts (e.g. gender)

* Questionnaires can include indexes or scales:
	* Latent traits (e.g. personality traits)
    * Attitudes (e.g. towards immigration)
    * An index (e.g. Social Economic Status)
